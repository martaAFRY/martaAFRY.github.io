When researching for new projects I like to chaotically make little mock-ups often based on examples that I have found online. I have started to keep these in local gits so that I can keep track of my edits. However, these gits end up on lots of different machines depending on what I work on at the moment and I tend to forget where they are or I may have deleted them due to space restrictions. I don't know how many times that I remebered that I have solved a similar problems before, but I can't remember where that code is.  

So, to get more structured I have decided to start publish some of these little hacks and small examples on a [GitHub repository][martaAFRY-gh]. If these help someone else feel free to use them, but remember these are just little mock-up hacks, not real stable code.
